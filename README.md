**Destinex** is the sample iOS app for the book: **[Exploring AI for iOS Development](https://academy.rudrank.com/product/ai)**.

Currently, Destinex focuses on implementationing using Apple's **MLX Swift** framework, showcasing how to use on-device machine learning for various tasks. Follow along with the book to see how Destinex evolves and how different AI concepts are brought to life!

## About the Name

The name **Destinex** took me some time, blending a word carrying some personal significance, **Destiny**, with concepts related to Artificial Intelligence and neural networks.

The core idea was to merge **Destiny**, representing potential paths and future outcome of AI, with a technical suffix, **-ex**. This ended up with some words:
* **Cortex:** Hinting at intelligence, cognitive processing, and the "brain" powering the models.
* **Nexus:** Suggesting connection, integration (like AI models working within iOS), and the app's core.
* **Vertex:** Representing structure, the nodes within neural networks (the building blocks of LLMs), and points within complex systems.
